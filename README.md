# Python for C# devs
As a C# developer with decades of experience, quickly becoming proficient at Python will be relatively easy.

We've broken the journey down into 20 lessons, where each 10 minute lesson will:
- Focus on a specific concept or feature that distinguishes Python from C#.
- List the key differences for each concept of feature from the perspective of a C# developer new to Python.
- Expand on the concept or feature with examples and code snippets to illustrate its usage and the differences from C#.

In addition, at the end of each less, we will:
- Provide links to additional resources for further reading.
- Include practice projects to apply your knowledge and enhance your skills.
