# Lesson 1: Python Installation and Setup (10 minutes)

Welcome to Python! In this first lesson, we'll get you set up with Python on your machine, create a development environment, and introduce you to running Python scripts and the Python interpreter.

## Python Installation:
1. **Download Python**: Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python. Make sure to choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Python**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system PATH during installation. This allows you to run Python from the command line or terminal.

## Setting up a Python Development Environment:
1. **Text Editor or IDE**: Python code can be written in any text editor, but using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can significantly improve your development experience. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code (VS Code), PyCharm, and Atom.

2. **Extensions or Plugins**: If you choose to use VS Code or other text editors, you can enhance your Python development environment by installing extensions or plugins specifically designed for Python development. These extensions provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging support.

## Running Python Scripts and Interacting with the Python Interpreter:
1. **Python Scripts**: Python scripts are text files with the `.py` extension containing Python code. You can create and edit them in your chosen text editor or IDE. To run a Python script, open your command line or terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and type `python your_script.py` (replace `your_script.py` with the actual filename).

2. **Python Interpreter (REPL)**: Python offers a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) or interactive interpreter. It allows you to execute Python code interactively. To start the Python interpreter, open your command line or terminal and type `python` or `python3` depending on your Python version. You should see the Python prompt (`>>>`), indicating that you can enter Python commands directly. To exit the interpreter, type `exit()` or press `Ctrl + D` (on macOS/Linux) or `Ctrl + Z` (on Windows).

## Key Differences for C# Developers:
- Unlike C#, Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the Python code is executed line by line at runtime. This differs from C#, which is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) code before execution.
- Python uses indentation (usually four spaces) to define code blocks instead of curly braces (`{}`) used in C#. Proper indentation is crucial in Python, as it determines the block structure and scope.
- Python uses dynamic typing, allowing variables to change their data type during runtime, unlike C#, which uses static typing.

Now that you've installed Python and set up your development environment, you're ready to dive deeper into Python's syntax and features. Stay tuned for Lesson 2, where we'll explore Python's basic syntax and indentation!

## Additional Resources:
- Official Python Website: https://www.python.org/
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- Atom: https://atom.io/

## Practice Projects:
- Write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, Python!" to the console.
- Use the Python interpreter to perform arithmetic operations and interact with Python's dynamic typing by assigning different data types to variables.
