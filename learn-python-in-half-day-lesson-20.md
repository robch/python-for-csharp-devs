# Lesson 20: Practice Projects (10 minutes)

Congratulations on completing the Python for C# devs lessons! In this final lesson, we'll provide you with some practice projects to apply your knowledge and enhance your Python skills.

## Practice Project 1: Text Analysis Tool
Create a Python script that analyzes a given text and provides the following information:

- Total number of words in the text.
- Total number of unique words in the text.
- Frequency of each word (how many times each word appears).
- Longest word in the text.

You can use Python's dictionaries to store word frequencies, and the `split()` method to split the text into words.

## Practice Project 2: Web Scraper
Build a web scraper that extracts information from a website. For example, you can scrape the titles and links of the latest news articles from a news website or extract data from a product page on an online store.

You can use Python's `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the web page and libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information.

## Practice Project 3: Data Visualization
Create a Python script that reads data from a CSV file and visualizes it using a library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`. For example, you can create bar charts, line plots, or scatter plots to visualize trends and relationships in the data.

You can use Python's `csv` module to read data from the CSV file, and the selected data visualization library to create the plots.

## Practice Project 4: Command-Line File Organizer
Write a Python script that organizes files in a directory based on their file extensions. For example, the script can move all the image files to an "Images" folder, all the text files to a "Text" folder, etc.

You can use Python's `os` module to interact with the file system and `shutil` module to move files.

## Key Takeaways:
- Practice projects are a great way to apply your knowledge and build practical skills in Python.
- Don't be afraid to explore Python's extensive library ecosystem and use third-party libraries to simplify complex tasks.
- Remember to use virtual environments to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts between libraries.

Congratulations again on completing the Python for C# devs lessons! By working on practice projects and exploring real-world applications, you'll become even more proficient in Python. Keep coding and enjoy your Python journey! üöÄ
